Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started, here's how we recommend you read the docs:
